Family Movie Scenes Database
Welcome to the Family Movie Scenes Database—an open-source project to catalog "inappropriate" scenes in movies with precise timestamps and customizable actions. Whether you’re a parent wanting to skip the gore, mute the swearing, or blur the awkward bits during family movie night, or a developer looking to build a smarter video player, this database is for you. It’s a slow-burn, community-driven effort to make movie-watching safer and more enjoyable for everyone.

Motivation
I've had a file server at home for a long time, packed with movies. We could access all the files on this server from any mobile device or PC connected to our home network. After a while, I built a simple web page with a video player, hosted on the server, so we could play and watch movies easily. But sometimes, unexpected inappropriate scenes would pop up, making the family feel uncomfortable. Manually skipping those scenes wasn’t a great experience either. So, I added a feature to my video player to automatically skip or blur a scene, or mute the sound for a few seconds. It was straightforward to implement, but the real challenge was creating a database of movies, their scenes, the type of each scene, and the action needed to handle it.

What’s This About?
Movies are great, but not every scene is right for every audience. This project logs specific moments in films—like violence, language, or nudity—with exact start and end times (in seconds). Each scene comes with options to skip it, mute the sound, or blur the visuals, so you can tailor playback to your family’s comfort level. Think of it as a DIY content filter, built by and for people who love movies but want a little control.
Started as a personal tool for family movie nights, it’s now open to grow with your help. Add scenes, refine the data, or plug it into your own video player—it’s all up to you.

How It Works
The database is a collection of JSON files, one per movie, identified by IMDb ID (e.g., tt0110357 for The Lion King). Each file lists scenes with timestamps and actions:
Example
json

{
  "tt0110357": {
    "title": "The Lion King",
    "duration": 5280,
    "version": "theatrical",
    "scenes": [
      {
        "start": 45.2,
        "end": 48.9,
        "reason": "frightening",
        "severity": 3,
        "mute": true,
        "skip": true,
        "description": "Mufasa’s death scene, intense for young kids"
      },
      {
        "start": 72.0,
        "end": 73.5,
        "reason": "violence",
        "severity": 2,
        "blur": true,
        "description": "Scar threatens Simba"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Fields
imdb_id: Unique IMDb identifier (e.g., tt0110357).

title: Movie name for readability.

duration: Total runtime in seconds (e.g., 88 minutes = 5280 seconds).

version: Cut of the film (e.g., theatrical, extended).

scenes: Array of flagged moments:
start/end: Time in seconds (decimals allowed, e.g., 45.2).

reason: Category (violence, language, nudity, frightening, etc.).

severity: 1-5 scale (1 = mild, 5 = extreme).

mute/skip/blur: Boolean actions (default false if omitted).

description: Optional details (e.g., “brief sword fight”).

Why Use It?
Parents: Filter movies on the fly—skip the scary parts, mute the bad words, or blur the gore without missing the story.

Developers: Build apps or video players that auto-apply these filters using the JSON data.

Community: Contribute scenes from your favorite films and help other families.

How to Use It
Browse: Check out the JSON files in the repo for movies you’re watching.

Integrate: Load the data into a video player (e.g., HTML5 <video> with JavaScript) to skip, mute, or blur scenes automatically. See this example (#) (link TBD).

Contribute: Add scenes for new movies or refine existing ones—see below!

Contributing
This is a slow-growing, volunteer-driven project, and every scene counts! Here’s how to pitch in:
Pick a Movie: Choose one you’ve watched (IMDb ID helps!).

Log Scenes: Note start/end times (use VLC or any player with seconds), reason, and actions.

Format It: Match the JSON structure above—copy an existing file and edit.

Submit: 
Fork this repo.

Add your JSON file (e.g., tt0110357.json) to the movies/ folder.

Open a pull request with a quick note (e.g., “Added The Lion King scenes”).

Guidelines:
Use seconds for timestamps.

Verify times match the movie’s version.

Keep descriptions short and neutral.

No rush—add one movie a month or one scene a week. Every bit helps!
Roadmap
Short-Term: Seed with 10-20 popular family movies.

Mid-Term: Build a simple web form for easier submissions.

Long-Term: Offer an API and grow to 100+ films with community help.
